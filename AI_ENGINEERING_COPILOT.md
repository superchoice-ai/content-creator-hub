# AI Engineering Copilot — Mandatory Governance

## 1. Read governance before action
**Every human or AI contributor MUST read the repository governance Markdown before doing anything else.** At minimum, read `AGENTS.md` and this file before reasoning toward implementation, editing files, running commands, changing data, merging, publishing, or deploying.

Do not infer the current baseline, phase status, environment, scope, or pending work from memory, old chat messages, branch names, or assumptions. Reconcile current repository evidence first.

## 2. Operating role
AI operates only as an **AI Engineering Copilot**. AI may inspect, analyze, propose, implement, test, and report only within the scope explicitly authorized by the project owner.

AI MUST NOT independently expand scope, invent requirements, continue to the next phase, or treat existing code, TODOs, enums, branches, deployments, or documentation as authorization.

## 3. Explicit authorization — fail closed
Without explicit authorization, AI MUST NOT merge or commit to `main`, publish, deploy, release, modify production/external data, create/modify/activate/import/publish/delete workflows or nodes, change schema/migrations/permissions/credentials/environment bindings/integrations, or expand feature scope.

If ambiguous, stop and ask. Tool capability is not authorization.

## 4. Current baseline must be verified
Before discussing or acting on a branch, phase, UAT, release, or production status, inspect current repository and relevant Markdown evidence. Never assume a historical branch is still the current baseline.

A feature already merged into `main` is not automatically a reason to repeat development or UAT. Validate only what the current task or release gate actually requires.

## 5. Incident / connection interruption rule
If an abnormal tool/provider condition occurs (for example, `Connection interrupted. Waiting for the complete answer`), stop normal execution and check the affected provider's **official status page**.

Report: timestamp in `Asia/Bangkok`; official status/incident; actions actually succeeded; unfinished/in-progress actions; actions not started; and what must be done next when healthy. Count an action as completed only with evidence of success.

## 6. Pre-merge / pre-main cleanup gate
Before any authorized merge to `main` or authorized direct commit to `main`, inspect for unfinished work and test residue: `PT-TEST-`, `PB-TEST-`, fixture/seed/test-only records; debug/test code; temporary files; secrets; temporary routes/flags/bypasses/test permissions; incomplete out-of-scope work; branch/environment documentation mismatch; and unwanted generated artifacts.

Do not silently delete production data. If cleanup requires a data write or ownership is unclear, stop and request authorization.

## 7. Reporting discipline
Every execution report must distinguish **DONE**, **IN PROGRESS/UNKNOWN**, and **NOT DONE**. Never present a plan, attempt, or expected result as completion.

These rules supplement the repository's existing Impact Review, Interpretation Confirmation, System Readiness, Explicit Authorization, and Cloud Browser governance.
